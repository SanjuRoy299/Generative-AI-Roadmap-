- **Model Training:** Techniques like gradient descent, backpropagation, regularization, and optimization strategies

# Phase 2: Core Generative AI Concepts
üìå Objective: Learn how Generative AI models work and how they can be applied.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generative Models Overview  
- **Model Types:** Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Normalizing Flows  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Understanding the evolution of models like GPT, LLaMA, Gemini, and Falcon  
- **Training & Fine-Tuning:** Techniques including transfer learning, RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), and fine-tuning with approaches such as LoRA and QLoRA  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Multimodal AI  
- **Text-to-Image:** Models like DALL¬∑E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney  
- **Audio & Speech:** Implementations such as Whisper for transcription, along with TTS frameworks  
- **Multimodal Architectures:** Frameworks that combine text, images, audio, or video (CLIP, Flamingo, GPT-V)

#  Phase 3: Building AI Agents
üìå Objective: Understand AI Agents and their ability to perform autonomous tasks.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ AI Agents & Agentic AI Concepts  
**Definition & Scope:** Agents as autonomous systems that perceive, reason, and act  

**Agent Frameworks:**  
- **AutoGPT & BabyAGI:** Early-stage implementations that use LLMs to plan and execute tasks  
- **CROEWL (or similar agent frameworks):** Designed for orchestrating and managing agent workflows  

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Frameworks for Agent Development  
#### **LangChain**  
- **Purpose:** Orchestrates LLM calls and chaining of prompts, memory, and data retrieval  
- **Features:** Connects LLMs with external data sources, APIs, and tools for dynamic decision-making  

#### **LlamaIndex (GPT Index)**  
- **Purpose:** Efficiently index and query large data sources  
- **Integration:** Often paired with LangChain for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios  

#### **Other Agent Frameworks**  
- **CROEWL & Similar Tools:** Facilitate multi-agent collaboration, orchestration, and hierarchical planning  
- **Custom Architectures:** Build or extend frameworks based on domain requirements  

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Memory & Context Management  
#### **Memory Systems**  
- **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Memory:** Strategies for context retention in conversations and multi-step tasks  
- **Vector Databases:** Utilize Pinecone, ChromaDB, or FAISS to manage embeddings and long-term context  

#### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
- Integrate external knowledge sources with LLMs using frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex
